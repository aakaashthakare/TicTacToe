What is interviewer really looking for ?


1. Can you understand the problem ?
   - gathering requirements 
   - understanding the edge case 
2. Can you break the problem down into solvable pieces ?
3. How do you design it ? And is your design EXTENSIBLE ?
   - features change all the time 
   - maintainability
   - easily migrate between libraries /  dependencies

Requirements gathering 
-----------------------

- Understand what Tic Toc Toe is 
- Think about all the ways in which you can generalize
- Keep in mind what you are generalizing makes sense
- Don't do over engineering
- Multiple players
  - 2 player
  - Human Player / Computer Player
  - Human Player : Profile, stats
  - Computer Player : AI, difficulty level, stats
- Symbols must be customizable
- Make board size flexible : 
  - 3x3, 4x4, 10x10
  - Rules are also flexible
- Different type of rules
- Don't think about anything that don't affect business logic
- How are players going to interact with our application ?
- Design should be able to incorporate different ways of interactions 
- MVP : Minimum Viable Product : running end to end
- Code quality
- Design Pattern

 Design approach
- bottom- up :
- top -down : We should use this so that we will always have whole picture and working code
